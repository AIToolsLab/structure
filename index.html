                most want to have her portrait painted by (Sargent), the kind of mother who always has time for her four

            <span>While I treasure the various worlds my mother has opened to me abroad, my life has been equally
                transformed by what she has shown me just two miles from my house.</span><span>As a ten year old, I
                often accompanied my mother to (name deleted), a local soup kitchen and children's center. While she
                attended meetings, I helped with the Summer Program by chasing children around the building and
                performing magic tricks.</span><span>Having finally perfected the "floating paintbrush" trick, I began
                work as a full time volunteer with the five and six year old children last June.</span><span>It is here
                that I met Jane Doe, an exceptionally strong girl with a vigor that is contagious.</span><span> At the
                end of the summer, I decided to continue my work at (name deleted) as Jane's tutor.</span><span>Although
                the position is often difficult, the personal rewards are beyond articulation.</span><span> In the seven
                years since I first walked through the doors of (name deleted), I have learned not only the idea of
                giving to others, but also of deriving from them a sense of spirit.</span>

            <br>
            <br>

            <span>Everything that my mother has ever done has been overshadowed by the thought behind
                it.</span><span>While the raw experiences I have had at home and abroad have been spectacular, I have
                learned to truly value them by watching my mother.</span><span>She has enriched my life with her passion
                for learning, and changed it with her devotion to humanity.</span><span>In her endless love of
                everything and everyone she is touched by, I have seen a hope and life that is truly
                exceptional.</span><span>Next year, I will find a new home miles away. However, my mother will always be
                by my side.</span>
